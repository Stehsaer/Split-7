# Split-7
A Console Chess Game

Idea originally created by Stehsaer

When the Black chess goes Vertical, the White chess goes horizontal,
When met with your enemy, you replace it and stop.
When met with nothing, you make your way forward non-stop
When met with your teammate, you stop and leave a gap.
When they split each other, who's the first to go precisely 7 in a line?
